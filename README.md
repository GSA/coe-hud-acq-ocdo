## Background

The mission of the [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE), housed within the [General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov) (GSA), is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization, improve the public experience, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. CoE accomplishes this by centralizing top government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

At the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/) (HUD), the Data Analytics CoE was tasked to define the analytics outcomes and priorities while assessing existing data, tools, and systems used by HUD programs and offices. HUD also desired the development of a strategy for analytics transformation that includes data governance, data management, and use cases for artificial intelligence technologies.

## Purpose

HUD has a need to establish an Office of the Chief Data Officer (OCDO) to manage data as a strategic asset and to create and implement an overall data management strategy. These high-level objectives reflect the need for improving and establishing organizational data standardization, integrity, availability, accessibility, usability, and sharing best practices at an enterprise level, to ultimately improve decision making throughout the agency.

This must be achieved in a manner that allows the selected Chief Data Officer (CDO) and HUD Executives to define the authority of the OCDO, finalize a communication plan, submit a Congressional review/approval package for the OCDO's operations, support that process, and provide base functionalities of an OCDO for HUD on an enterprise-wide level. Additionally, this must be done in a way that establishes and maintains a formal data governance steering committee and working group, data quality and data certification policies, an enterprise-wide data asset inventory, business glossary, metadata and master data management, a HUD Open Data Portal, and a self-service data analytics environment.
